# Preface

Top 5 videos have emerged as a popular internet meme. Characterized by a Spanish-accented English voiceover, blue video background, and featuring five videos each time, these videos have gained significant attention and viewership on various platforms. This style was initially defined by YouTube user [squewe](https://www.youtube.com/@squewe). Leveraging the simplicity and humor, [squewe](https://www.youtube.com/@squewe) has uploaded 224 videos and amassed 1.06 million subscribers on YouTube. [As of July 22, 2023]. Similar creators have also appeared on Bilibili, such as [squwe@bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/1211770205) and [坦然奥特@bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/2014827662).

# Steps

1. Topic Selection: The choice of topic is paramount. Your title is the essence of the video, such as "Top 5 Burgers," "Top 5 Funny Faces," or "Top 5 Cats." Any intriguing or mundane content can be used as a topic.

2. Materials: Your source material can come from any videos. You can find them in meme compilations or conduct your own search.

3. List: Organize the videos you found into a list. You may have more than five videos, so you can select which ones to include in the final video.

4. Video Draft:
   - Summarize the order of the videos in a list, preferably with links to each ranked video.
   - Compose a script for the selected content. This script will be processed into audio using a text-to-speech software (the familiar "ello guys" introduction). Note that for optimal audio effect, some manual corrections are needed for pronunciation, such as:
      - guys -> gays
      - number [n] -> numero [n]
      - ABC -> A.B.C (adding pauses with dots for a natural reading flow)

   Optionally, I've listed a sample document below. Feel free to use or modify it.

    4. Video B
    3. Video A
    2. Video C
    Honorable Mention: Video F
    1. Video E

    # TTS Script

    Hello gays.
    Today we have a list of top 5 xxxxxx.
    Number 5. [.....]. 
    Number 4. [.....].
    Number 3. [.....].
    Number 2. [.....].
    Honorable mention.
    Number 1. [.....].

    (Note: Some words are not pronounced correctly, requiring manual corrections, such as "guys")
   ```

5. Text-to-Speech (TTS): Import your prepared script into [https://lazypy.ro/tts](https://lazypy.ro/tts/?voice=6-2-2&service=Oddcast&text=&lang=Spanish&g=A), which uses the Jorge (Spanish, Castilian) text-to-speech model by Oddcast. The audio generated by this model embodies the essence of TOP5 videos. After entering the text, click "Say It" to generate the audio. You can save it by right clicking.

6. Editing:
   - Open video editing software such as **Adobe Premiere Pro**, **Final Cut Pro**, etc.
   - Import the TOP5 video files.
   - Import the text-to-speech audio files.
   - Create a background with the color `rgb(0, 255, 255)` or `#00ffff`.
   - Add text with the color `rgb(255, 255, 255)` or `#ffffff`, using the Windows system font `MS Reference Sans Serif`.
   - Combine the video clips and the audio by repeating the process.
   - At the end, you can add your signature or leave it blank.

   Throughout the editing process:
   - Keep each video's length moderate.
   - You can compress video bitrate and resolution slightly to achieve a vintage electronic feel.
   - The honorable mention should have minimal thematic relation to the main content.

7. Publishing: Upload the video to Internet platform.
